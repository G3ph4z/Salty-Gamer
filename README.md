# Salty-Gamer
Salty Gamer is a bot that scrapes all the video descriptions on YouTube which are used to trick gamers into downloading malware.

It will try to extract the download link and the password for the file, then download it and upload it to tria.ge for further analysis, and then share the IoCs.
